Features :

- ability to add the properties you are interested in to do a map comparison and see where they all are relative to school

- would it be best to keep the reviews in the apartment complex's document, and then link the post to an account and also keep track of posts in a person's account that way it is present that way I don't have to check every user to see if there are reviews.

- Make a system that highlights safe areas on the google maps using color coordination

- make assumptions about a neighborhoods, the number of old people per mile the number of coffie shops/ arteasinal mustache parlors/ vape shops = vape shop if there are 5 schools in a mile radius it is a great place for a family, also maybe have stats about school rankings

- have a feature to make an overall statement about the region, maybe draw from outside news articles and stats like coffee shops per mile
