Favorited Users : With there being a potential for there to be multiple collections of active users and inactive users, how should i store a reference to the user. Maybe by document_Id, and as soon as someone goes offline do you loose connection to the user. If a user goes to view a list of all the favorited users, you should then remove the user if they are no longer found.
